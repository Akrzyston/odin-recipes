        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Eggs</li>
                <li>Milk</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Pepper</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Crack eggs on a flat surface (helps ensure shells stay out of the mix) into a bowl that's deep enough for some serious whisking.</li>
                <li>To make scrambled eggs on the stove, melt a teaspoon of butter or olive oil, or a combination of both, in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Butter and oil add rich flavor to the eggs and help prevent sticking, but you can also use cooking spray.</li>
                <li>When the butter starts to bubble, or a drop of water added to the pan sizzles, slowly pour in the egg mixture. Immediately reduce the heat to medium-low and as soon as the eggs begin to "set" or form a slightly solid base (a minute or two), gently stir with a rubber spatula.</li>
                <li>As soft curds begin to form, add minced herbs, shredded cheese, crumbled bacon, chopped scallions, saut√©ed mushrooms, chopped tomato, or anything else you like. Gently fold those ingredients into the eggs. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Gently scrap the bottom of the pan, turning the eggs until almost all of the egg mixture has cooked through but there are still a few wet areas. Remove the pan from the heat and continue to stir until the eggs finish cooking using only the residual heat from the pan. </li>
            </ol>
